<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Chalkley's Chronicles</h1>

<p>Lyman Chalkley's three-volume <em>Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish Settlement
in Virginia Extracted from the Original Court Records of Augusta County,
1745-1800</em> (Rosslyn, Va., 1912-1913; reprint, 1965)&nbsp; is a popular
reference work that contains abstracts taken from the Augusta County court
records. Chalkley's <em>Chronicles</em> may serve as a useful source for leads
and to identify original records to consult, but there are many reasons to
exercise caution when using it.</p>

<p>Before the publication of the <em>Chronicles</em>, the National Society of
the Daughters of the American Revolution, which had been approached to become
the publisher, commissioned genealogist and historian Thomas Forsythe Nelson to
make an analysis of the work. Nelson's detailed evaluation, in which the
Society as well as Herbert Putnam, who was then the Librarian of Congress, and
historian J. Franklin Jameson all concurred, was that the typescript of
Chalkley's abstracts that had been submitted should not be published. Nelson
found that the abstracts contained an abundance of transcription errors,
erroneous dates, misspelled names, material omissions, and other serious
mistakes. He concluded that the abstracts were &quot;condensed to the point of
mutilation&quot; and that many entries misrepresented the contents of the
original documents.</p>

<p>Nelson also pointed out that Chalkley had abstracted only some of the
records that pertained to persons and families in which he was interested.
Publication of the abstracts could easily lead to the erroneous conclusion that
the absence in the abstracts of information about a person or a family meant
that there was no information on the person or family in the county court's
records.</p>

<p>Nelson's whole report, containing detailed comparisons between Chalkley's
abstracts and the original records, was published as a substantial pamphlet
under the authority of the 21st Congress, National Society, Daughters of the
American Revolution (Washington, D.C., 1912) with the title <em>Report on the
Chalkley Manuscripts.</em></p>

<p>Mary Smith Lockwood, an honorary vice-president-general of the Society,
nevertheless proceeded on her own to have the typescript of Chalkley's
abstracts published in the familiar three-volume edition.</p>

<p>Many users have no doubt concluded wrongly, as Nelson predicted, that the absence
of references in Chalkley's <em>Chronicles</em> indicated a lack of data; and
many other users have certainly been mislead by using Chalkley's faulty
abstracts and not consulting the original records. Chalkley's <em>Chronicles</em>
can be a valuable resource if it is used as a first finding aid for citations
but not as a correct reproduction or representation of the full rich entries in
the county court's original manuscript records. </p>
