              This collection consists of one Hollinger box and two oversize
              folders, containing a variety of documents relating to Mrs.
              Margaret G. Weaver and her ancestors, particularly her grandfather
              John E. Roller. Roller, born near Mt. Crawford in 1845, was a
              prominent lawyer, lecturer, and antiquarian in the Shenandoah
              Valley.
