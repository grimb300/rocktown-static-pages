<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Keezletown area, Rockingham County, Virginia. From Keezletown proceed 1/2 mile north on Route 717 (Indian Trail Road). Large poultry farm across tracks on left. Cemetery is in open field about 400 feet behind the last of the five poultry houses. Farm is owned by Ted and Stephanne Strickler Byrd. When visiting, call the Byrds first. They prefer you to go across track at old Keezle house and walk to plot, particularly if ground is soft.</td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Margaret (Brock) Wilson of Harrisonburg, Virginia, purchased a new headstone listing the Brocks buried in this cemetery. J.W. Wayland in 1930 wrote the notes in the Remarks Column and noted: Other persons are said to be buried outside the wall of this small graveyard - the graves unmarked - George Keezell, founder of Keezeltown probably, and maybe other Keezells.</td></tr>
