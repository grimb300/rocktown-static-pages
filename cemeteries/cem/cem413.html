<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>No sign of this cemetery in 2008. In 1967 J. Robert Swank wrote: On the John Shank place. One inscribed stone only was found. This stone was in three pieces. There were field stones to 15 graves and evident of as many as 50 graves in the plot. In 1795 Ezekiel Harrison sold land to Philip Roads. He died leaving property to 12 children, one of which was Lydia wife of Tobais Beam. They sold land to Christian Kratzer who had 1360 acres at time of his death in 1859. Mentioned in deeds as heirs were Ann (Chrisman), George Kratzer, J. & Elizabeth Jennings, Jonathan & Catherine Shafer, J. & susan Rhinehart, Gordon Kratzer. Anna Chrisman, wife of Dr. Burke Chrisman, received 172 acres as her share. They later bought from other heirs. Following the death of the Chrismans, the property was sold to George B. Harrison. We found no connection with the Shultz family, which may have been prior to 1795 and recorded before Rockingham County was organized.</td></tr>
