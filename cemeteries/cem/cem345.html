She died 18 Sep 1858 in the Mill Creek area of Rockingham Co, VA according to the information given in the Rockingham County Courthouse by her grandson Edward PENCE (a substantial tree has grown quite near the tombstone, but it seems to read Died Sep. 19, 1858 [sic, a day later than the report in the Courthouse]). A small foot stone is visible reading "S.K." A fuller account of her life is given at http://www.carpenter-zimmerman.org/reunion/articles.html</td></tr>
