<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 2011 no attempt was made to locate this cemetery. In the 1960s the D.A.R. wrote; This cemetery has been almost obliterated from neglect. These records were taken before cemetery was in such bad state. Dr. John W. Wayland notes and records from 22 Dec 1925 from his visit to cemetery along with Mr. Kaylor; The Grattan house (tall brick) stands about 1/3 of a mile east of the Valley Pike (Route 11), above the river. The old graveyard is in a field about halfway between the house and the Pike on the southwest side of the lane leading in from the Pike. The wall around the graveyard is falling. The old stage road, Mr. Kaylor says, used to pass farther east, near the house. Notes in the Remarks Column are from John W. Wayland records.</td></tr>
