<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Notes in "Remarks" column were provided by Lois B. Bowman.  In 2002 Ms. Bowman noted: "In Shenandoah National Park listing, this was called the "Nanges (Angie) Shifflett Cemetery.  I believe the locals told them 'Nanges Shifflett' and they didn't know how to interpret it. Evidently named for Vernangus Shifflett, who first married Newton Shifflett, had Shifflett children, was widowed, then married David M. Lamb on July 23, 1868, in Greene County, VA., no further children."  The Shenandoah National Parks records show there are about 8 to 25 burials here.</td></tr>
