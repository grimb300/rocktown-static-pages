<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>War Branch/Peaked Mountain area, Rockingham County, Virginia.  Take Route 33 west to Route 613 (Whitemore Shop Road).  Turn right onto Route 613 and go 1.2 mile to Route 726 (War Branch Road).  Turn left onto Route 726.  Go 6/10 mile and on the right side of road is Samuel Brown's property.

<tr></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 2003 we found driving up to cemetery is very rough.  Definitely need a heavy duty pick-up to get there.  Looking up the hill from Route 726, you will see a chimney standing and cemetery is up the hill and to the left in trees.  Cemetery has a broken wooden fence around it.  Stones are broken and down.  Outside the fence are field stones.  In 1967 J. Robert Swank note; "The slave burial plot adjoins marked by many field stones.  The Crawford plantation contained more than 1200 acres.  A division of the property was made after 1844 as follows: John & William 414 acres, George 275 acres, John 200 acres, Benjamin 240 acres, George & John 712 plus acres."</td></tr>
