<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>This cemetery is also referred to as Riverside Cemetery.  These stones are not in any rows and are just recorded in the groups that they are near. Many are enclosed in their own fence within the big fenced area. There are also some enclosed areas where no gravestones were found.  In the cemetery there are several family areas that have iron fencing around them as well as several graves that are not in fenced areas.  Scotts and Ogheltree are enclosed in the same fence. (This is the area the D.A.R. recorded as the Amos Scott Lot.)  The Leckies, Fitchs, and Young are buried together inside of one fence.    Murrays are buried together.  The Trouts  and Whiteside are buried together inside a fence.  Conelly and Batemans are buried together.  Roberts and Weasts are buried together.  It is clear that there are many unmarked graves which may have had headstones at one time but have been removed by flooding or vandals or never had markers.    The Following is written on a sign beside the graveyard.  "The Riverside Graveyard was established on land deeded by Molly & John Carthrae Sr. to the Methodist churches trustees in 1793.  Soon a log church was built at water’s edge in the upper end of the cemetery.  On 26 Feb 1809 Bishop Francis Asbury preached here. Although South River served conveniently for Baptisms, occasionally regular services were cancelled due to high water.  Sometimes the congregation found itself marooned when the river rose unexpectedly during a service. This structure was abandoned in 1846 and the congregation temporarily met in a brick church on Main Street built and later vacated by the Presbyterians. In 1853 the congregation built a wooden church on the same site as todays United Methodist Church Building.
Most of the remaining cemetery stones date to the mid 1800s.  Graves include Harrison Bateman, a boatman on the river for 50 years; Capt. George W. Eutsler a cabinet maker and slave trader; Rev. David Wood, a revered African-American who preached in Port  for 24 years.  Amos Scott, an early mill owner; Jane Dundore, first wife of John Dundore owner of a early tannery.  At least 3 confederate soldiers are buried here: Col. William A. Maupin, a village blacksmith, Col. of the 85th Regiment of Va. Militia when the Civil War began; James G. Layton who was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville and C. R. Allen of the Nottaway Light Artillery.  There is also a memorial stone for Pvt. Joseph M. McCray Co. B. 1st. Va. Infantry who was killed in the Battle of Port Republic but whose gravesite was never discovered.
This spot was a favorite swimming hole for decades, and over the years many of the older stones were lost after being used by the town’s young folks as diving platforms.  When a new cemetery was organized in 1897 many bodies were re-intered there.  The restoration and maintenance of the cemetery is a project of the Society of Port Republic Preservationists. Sheep are purchased each spring to act as lawn mowers."</td></tr>
