<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Dayton, Rockingham County, Virgnia. Take Route 42 south (John Wayland Highway) to Dayton.  On the west side of Route 42, 100 ft south of Rt. 257, on the Joseph Meyerhoeffer family farm in a pasture field.  In 2009, follow the old railroad bed west for 1/4 mile and the remaining  tombstone is 30 feet west in the field. (Note:  In 1967 Mr. Swank said it was along the C & W Railroad track.  In 2002 track is gone.)</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 1967 J. Robert Swank noted "This is said to be the location of the Primative Baptist Church Cemetery.  There is but one marker on this plot.  Others were also buried here.  From the Fishback History we find Benjamin Fishback born 17 July 1793 died 11 March 1836.  The 11th child of Herman Fishback (the 6th child of Herman the immigrant, of Germania and Christena Hoffman) married 4 Feb 1823 to Sarah Jane Rice born 7 Nov 1802 died 15 Feb 1875.  Their child: Albert Calvin Fishback 19 July 1829 - 2 April 1892 married 11 June 1854 to Sarah Heatwole 14 June 1835 - 11 Feb 1898."  In 1931 John W. Wayland recorded Benjamin Fishback, Sarah J. Fishback, and Benjamin Franklin Fishback, their son, as all three being on one stone -- today there appears to be a new stone with just Benjamin and Sarah J. Fishback on it.</td></tr>
