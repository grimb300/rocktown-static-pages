Ms. Bowman also notes there are a couple remnants of metal markers in front part of cemetery indicating there may be more burials here.  (Note: Arch Roach is buried in this cemetery and there is another cemetery named "Arch Roach Family Cemetery" which was probably on Arch's property.  Believe that Smith Roach was son of Arch Roach.)  From the book "The Undying Past: History of Shenandoah National Park" by Darwin Lambert in 1989, on page 284 it states there are about 45 burials with the oldest being Arch Roach; and inscriptions hand-carved on fieldstones LB, JCR, NPS.</td></tr>
