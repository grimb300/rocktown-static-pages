<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>There are no graves recorded in this cemetery.  The following notes were furnished by Patricia Turner Ritchie.  "Tom Ritchie's brother, Charles Ritchie of Rt. 2 Broadway, pointed out the cemetery to us about 1996.  No carved stones.  There were 9 depressions and rock markers, but there could have been others.  Once Charles' father, Algernon 'Gem' Ritchie, was nearby and heard a sound like crying coming from the graveyard.  When he investigated, Susie Bible was in the cemetery crying.  Some of her people are buried there."  (Pat Ritchie note: Susie Bible was an old lady who walked the roads with a pack on her back.  Little children found her scary. My grandmother Ruth Turner & my aunt Lettie Albrite remember seeing her when they were children. Sometimes the children would play "Susie Bible" by carrying a sack on their backs.  I have not found who Susie's parents were but I do have a picture of her from Nora Trumbo Heatwole's collection.  There is a ridge nearby which Gem & his children used to call the "Susie Tea Ridge."  Kathleen thinks it was named for Susie Bible but is not sure.  Donald Ritchie, Charles & Tom's nephew, has a log home past Kathleen's house which is on the "Bible place."  Bible Run flows out of this hollow.  Adam & Fannie Fawley Shickle used to live on the Bible place.  He told Kathleen that he lived good up there.  He didn't have any problems until the hunting laws & seasons were put into effect.  He said that the hunting laws weren't God's laws, and he continued to hunt since he wasn't breaking God's law.)</td></tr>
