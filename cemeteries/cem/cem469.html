<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Mrs. Thompson says that Wilson Asbury Bazzle owned land on the other side where there was another cemetery which is no more. Hannah Pickering Bazzle may have been buried there. In Marie Koontz Arrington book Mt. Valley People page 31 she wrote: There are a number of unmarked graves. Only one name was found on a stone that of Margaret Bazzle. This cemetery is on land owned during the 1800s by the Bazzle family. It is to the southeast of James Thompson Sr's dwelling which was at one time Fairview School. When I attended school there in the late 1920s I was in this cemetery. It seems to me there were more stones.</td></tr>
