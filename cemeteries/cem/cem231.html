<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Cemetery is not maintained and cattle have roamed through the area.  In 1967 J. Robert Swank noted, "There is indications of perhaps as many as 50 graves in the plot which is overgrown.  Some deed records found in the Rockingham County Courthouse: 1813-to Salvage from Samuel & Barbara Swartzs part of the original grant to John Gum, conveyed to M. Culp, to Christian Coffman to Swartz to Salvage; 1814-to Salvage from Henry Hoover two tracts granted Wm. Rutledge 1745 - to Jacob Brunk, to Daniel Brunk, to Henry Hoover to Salvage - these lands were on Linville Creek adj. Wengers, Ackers, etc.; 1816-to Salvage from Joshua & George Kring their interest in their father John Kring estate - The tax list for Rockingham County 1813 showed Salvage as owning 454 acres - he was on the 1792 list of Tenth Legion Tithables.  Some early marriages recorded in Courthouse: 1787-Benjamin Salvage to Catherine Kring, 1787-George Kring to Mary Sanger, 1797-Edwin Nicholas to Elizabeth Kring, 1801-Joshua Kring to Hannah Chrisman, 1802-Henry Kring to Nancy Harrison, 1811-James Suter to Nancy-widow of Henry Kring, 1817-George Kring to Betsy Phillips, 1818-Abraham Miller to Frances Salvage, 1821-Elizabeth Salvage to Richard Winfield, 1833-John Calvert to Catherine Salvage.  John Kring had following children-Joshua was a merchant in New Market, Va. Also a schoolmaster; Henry; Frederick; George was a silversmith in New Market; and John.  Benjamin Salvage had following children-Benjamin, adopted by Gov. Holmes of Mississippi and died there; John, killed by his business partner in Little Rock, Ark.; Gideon, settled in Missouri; Ephriam married Frances Strickler, dau. John; Michael, buried home cemetery; Elizabeth married Richard Winfield.  Catherine (Kring) Salvage is said to have been buried in New Market, Va."  In 2001 Winfield Massie wrote a letter to the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society detailing the following: "We got permission from the Presbyterian Church where there was a Winfield Section and had the markers for Dr. Richard Winfield and his wife moved to the Church cemetery.  We also had a large flat marker placed in the Kring Salvage Cemetery listing all those known to be buried there according to records at the Dayton Library.  The Howard Hartman family was gracious to us in allowing us to do this.  No human remains were moved."  (Refer to historical society records for more data on the Winfields.)</td></tr>
