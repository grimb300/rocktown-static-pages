<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Fulks Run, Rockingham County, Virginia. From Funks Run Grocery store on Route 259, take a left (south) onto route 612.  After approximately 2.5 miles, you will pass Harlan Mongold's house, formerly the Genoa Schoolhouse.  Take the next left down a private gravel lane.  Continue on that road to the end, about 0.5 miles.  The cemetery is on the property of Linwood and Treva Miller.  As you look at the house, the cemetery is to the right in the field.  It was fenced by Lloyd, Kale, Patricia and Hobart Turner and Stanley Fawley in 1966 with contributions from various Turner family members.</td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 1967 J. Robert Swank noted that "There are perhaps fifteen or twenty other unmarked graves."    In 1999 Patricia Turner Ritchie noted "The property is the James Turner homeplace, the first Turner in the Brocks Gap area.  There are few tombstones but quite a few graves marked with river rocks.  Carved tombstones for James II and James III are along the fence, and at the head of James II are a pair of river rocks that could well be those of James I and his wife."    Notes in the "Remarks" column were furnished by Patricia Turner Ritchie.</td></tr>
