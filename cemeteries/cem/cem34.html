<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>The marker has 23 names that are listed as grave 001 thru 023.    It only lists the names.  All dates, ages, remarks and graves 024 thru 027 are taken from J. Robert Swank's records of 1967 and from a paper titled "The Old Methodist Burial Ground" located in the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society files.  When the church was enlarged the next of kin moved their relatives to other cemeteries and the remaining burials were put into one grave with the above marker.    Mr. Swank noted "Mr. & Mrs. Gordon Rodgers of KY told me 5/4/1969 at monument that his grandparents Mr. & Mrs. Gordon Rodgers were buried in the Methodist Church Cemetery on High St.  His father, Nevelle Gordon, was buried out in Dayton during Civil War.  The home stood where the Schrum Brickyard later was located."  Notes from the paper "The Old Methodist Burial Ground" (no indication who wrote this) are as follow:  On the Southwest corner of the square, according to the original plat of the town, Lot No. 12, containing one acre, (this site now being occupied by (the Church of the Brethren) was deeded in 1789 by Robert & Rebecca Harrison to David Harner, Jeremiah Ragan, Richard Ragan, John Hicks, James Mitchell, John Harrison, & Joseph Denny, Trustees of the Methodist Meeting House.    Upon this lot, and built of logs, was the first school in Harrisonburg; used also & being the first Methodist Church in Rockingham County, being completed for use in 1794.  Previous to this, services were held in the open air & in private residences.    Later on - March 10, 1805, a larger and more commodious building was projected, & by August 10, 1806, was completed & ready for use; at which time Bishop Asbury was present and preached the first sermon.  He makes mention of the occasion in his journal, giving the size as being, 40x48; also saying the building would hold from 1,600 to 1,800 (a rather large estimate, and showing that it is easy for wise men to be mistaken).    Under the shadows of this dear old church was what, perhaps, may be said to be the first burial ground cemetery in Harrisonburg, there were private burial grounds in those early days in the town.   Much Methodist history centers around this place and some of the great men of Methodism preached from its high pulpit.  Here Bishop Asbury held Conference in 1809; Bishop McKendree being present also, and Christopher Frye, the preacher in charge and host to the conference used for fairs etc. and as a drilling place for military companies.  On Sunday, Sept. 19, 1865, it fell with a tremendous crash which startled the town and scared the boys who had gathered there for their usual Sunday feats of daring, climbing and general gymnastics.  But the old church was king even until the last and with its dying groans warned the boys of their danger in time for them to get away.  Note: On Oct 27, 2003 the contents of the crypt with the 23 names were moved to Woodbine Cemetery at the corner of Ott and West Market St. The Daily News Record of Oct 28 described the ceremony.</td></tr>
