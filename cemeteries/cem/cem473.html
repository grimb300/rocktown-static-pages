<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Craney Island, Rockingham County, Virginia. Cemetery is on a rise west of the creek south of Route 794 (Craney Island Road). Note that (in 2010) Craney Island Rd. turns east from Rt. 11 about 2 1/2 miles south of New Market.</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In Algernon Good's book, Shadowed By The Massanutten, published in 1992, he wrote the following information: Cemetery is on a rise west of the creek south of state road 794, only a few stones remain there today. To locate, begin at the fence in front of Walter McDaniel's home, then proceed in a line due south with the Endless Caverns coffee shop 148 large steps (yards), this should place you at a line between the late home of Herman Buhl to the east and the large Rosenberger brick home to the west. A former pupil (Mr. John Buhl) of the Craney Island school about 1908-13, told this writer; in the spring, the teacher would take the class down the road to the old Byrd cemetery, and each student would make up a list from the stones of those persons buried here with all the dates. He later told me he didn't think the above list included all that are buried here. Mr. Good wrote: The O'roarks lived at the Fairfax line on the mountain road. In recent years various people have tried to locate this cemetery without success. It has been said that all the stones have been removed. No attempt was made to locate this cemetery in 2009.</td></tr>
