<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Beldor Area, Rockingham County, Virginia. Take Route 33 East from Elkton, Rockingham County, Virginia.  Turn right on Beldor Road.  Go 3.7 miles on Beldor Road until you see a large old barn on the left.  There will be a large metal gate & parking for one car.  The chain on the metal gate can be unclipped.  Cemetery is behind the barn & to the left on the hillside.  You must cross a very wet area around an old Springhouse, pass under an electric fence, wade a stream, climb another fence & then climb the hill.</td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>The owner doesn't mind visitors to the cemetery.  There are only about ten readable headstones.  There are many broken and unreadable fieldstones.  In March of 2002, Robert Crawford recorded this cemetery & found that relatives keep it cleared.   In 1987 Lois Bowman wrote:  The cemetery is not in Shenandoah National Park and is on a hill above Hawksbill Creek.</td></tr>
