<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Cemetery is well maintained with fence around it. In 1987 Brett & Judy Nordgren provided the data and notes in the Remarks Column. They also noted; The site is presently occupied by a small Mennonite Church, the original United Brethren Church building having been removed in 1976. Inscription on historical monument: "Mary Whitesel, widow of Peter Whitesel Sr. and her eight children came from Maryland to Virginia in 1778. In 1824 her son Peter Jr. donated the land on which a log church building was erected. The first United Brethren Church building in Virginia. The log structure was replaced in 1874 and in 1893 the second building was replaced by a frame building which was removed in 1976. Mother Mary Whitesel is buried in an unmarked grave."  Note by Brett & Judy Nordgren: The Widow Mary story is not correct. Peter Weitzel, Sr., his wife Anne and 6 or 7 of their children, who eventually numbered 9, came from Leitersburg, Maryland sometime around 1791.</td></tr>
