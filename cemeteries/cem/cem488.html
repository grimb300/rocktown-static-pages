<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 2011 no attempt was made to locate this cemetery. This cemetery has been documented by numerous sources, which have conflicting recordings. Some of them are: the WPA Record of 1936; Daily News Record Harrisonburg, Virginia, article 18 Nov 1966; Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society Newsletter Vol. I No. 3 Winter 1979; and the 1937 record of John W. Wayland, 26 WFCHS, Stewart Bell Jr. Archives, Handley Regional Library, Winchester, Virginia. Mr. Wayland noted-the old graveyard is out in a field, unfenced. Two or three other graves are marked with rough stones. Doubtless a number of persons are buried there whose graves are not marked. The plat is about 200 yards (maybe 150) SW of the great spring.</td></tr>
