<tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Rockingham County, Virginia. From Court Square in Harrisonburg, Virginia, go west on Route 33. After 7.7 miles turn left on Route 613 (Clover Hill Road). After 1.3 miles, turn west on Route 742 (Robinson Road). After 1.1 miles Croushorn Lane is on the left. On the southwest corner of this intersection is the cemetery.</td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>On south side of road there is a mowed section with a small iron fence enclosing a small monument and two footstones. In 1967 J. Robert Swank wrote: Dry River Mennonite Church formerly Union Church. The road seperates two sections of the cemetery. (Two church buildings were previously here.) On north side of road a fieldstone was found with letters P.D. Some of the Denton family are said to be buried here. From records in Clerks office it was found that Wesley G. Denton was a landowner in this section. The plot covers, perhaps, a half acre and is in the most unkept condition of any found. More markers probably could be located with the removal of honeysuckle and other growth. Snyder, Bud and four or five wives are buried here-no stone.</td></tr>
