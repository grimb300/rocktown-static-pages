<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Notes from Patricia Turner Ritchie in 1985 - "There are approximately 15 graves marked by river rocks.  Four have extensive carving of names, dates, and religious verses.  There was a fence once, and two large cedar trees probably mark the original gate."  Notes in "Remarks Column" were furnished by Mrs. Ritchie.  Mrs. Ritchie added the following note - "A son of Frederick Crider, Jacob Crider, born about 1787, married Magdaline Waggoner in Rockingham County, VA in 1815.  She was the daughter of John Waggoner.  Three of their sons are buried in this cemetery, Ephraim, Henry, and Jonathan.  Mr. Yankey recently learned that Jacob & Magdaline had moved west to be with some of their children and died there."  In 1967 J. Robert Swank noted "Crider family plot on Shaver Mountain about 2 miles past Post Office.  Mr. & Mrs. Riley Crider, Mr. & Mrs. Frederick Crider and others buried here."</td></tr>
