<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 2008 property owner Mark Arbogast advised us there are no stones for burials on the property. In 1967 J. Robert Swank wrote: All stones have been removed but the three Summers stones were found on the place. It is not known how many were buried here but the deeds included a graveyard of .109 acre. The land was conveyed in 1899 by Solomon Summers to E.D. Davis, by Davis to D.E. Layman 1903, by Layman to Dr. Dyerly, and by Dyerly to Strawderman. Summers names found in deeds were Abraham, Michael, John, Solomon K.</td></tr>
