<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Cemetery also referred to as the Old Bowman Graveyard.  Property presently owned by J. Alvin Byers.  In 2002 the only marker belongs to Jacob Geil.  We did find a couple of footstones & half of an old sandstone marker with no writing on it among a pile of tires.  In 1954 Rev. C. E. Nair wrote "The old Bowman graveyard at the Samuel Bowman Mill place where Jacob Geil, Germany immigrant, was buried."  In 1967 J. Robert Swank noted "None of the original markers remain.  A monument to Jacob Geil has been placed.  The plot is in open field.  There were others buried here."</td></tr>
