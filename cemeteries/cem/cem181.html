Robert Swank wrote:  "This plot is near or on the boundary line of the Hiram Hoover (later Rawley May, now Turner) and the Henry Ford (later the T. Funk & sons, now Dove) places.  It is not known who were buried here.  The land, 5041 acres, was granted 24 Sep 1799 to Dr. Asher Waterman & Shipman and later sold, in part, to Derrick Pennybacker; Philip K., Ephriam and Jacob A. Mitchell; to Conrad Custer, Arthur Croton, Jacob Shoemaker and others.  There is a story of a peddler having been robbed and killed and buried on the Ford place."</td></tr>
