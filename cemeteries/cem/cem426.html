<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>In 1967 J. Robert Swank wrote: One stone with inscription was found. There are indications of 15 or more graves, some marked with field stones. In checking back on owners of the land, we find the names: Keister, Shoemaker, Shaver, Wine, Zimmerman, Brown, Parrett. On the former William Keister place, along west side of Route 752, south of Mt. Zion Brethren Church, there are three or more graves. Unknown and unmarked. Tradition has it a burial place for Indians. Clyde Keister state the Indian graves were along the fence on south side of Mt. Zion Brethren Church, in the field. In 2008 no attempt was made to locate this cemetery.</td></tr>
