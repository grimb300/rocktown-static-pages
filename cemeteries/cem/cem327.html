<tr><td><strong>Notes</strong></td><td>Notes in remarks column are taken from Patricia Ritchie records. Patricia Ritchie notes: This cemetery is bordered on three sides by the Gail and Shirley Smith Hupp farm. There is one large monument to mark this cemetery in the field. He had hoped to engrave the names of those buried there but was not able to complete the project. Mrs. Hupp reports that there used to be some carved markings along fence on the upper end of the cemetery. According to the notes of Lewis Yankey, these people are buried in the old cemetery down the hill from the present-day Caplinger Cemetery at Criders, Virginia. Most dates are from his notes, census records, the 1850 mortality schedule for Rockingham County, or the Rockingham County Death Register. In 1967 Mr. J. Robert Swank noted: It is said there are some slaves and possibly Indians buried here.</td></tr>

<tr id=sid70996><td></td><td></td><td>Row</td><td>Noah</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Notes from Patricia (Turner) Ritchie. Noah Row is not in the 1850, 1870 or 1880 Rockingham Co. census. He was a member of Phanuels Lutheran Church at Dovesville (now Bergton) & was a communicant on 2 Jul 1871 & 29 June 1873 in Warren Souder's history of Martin Luther Lutheran Church. Same church records, in March 1876, Noah Row, Catherine Row, & Mary Row voted to have church trusteeship with the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod. All the other church members voted for another Synod. This was the time of their church breakup. In his Whetzel history, Lewis Yankey wrote that Noah Row was a brother of David Row and lived in another old Whetzel house across the river at the lower end of the John Whetzel place (page 38). David Row was from Shenandoah County & traded farms with John Whetzel on 11 January 1845. However, the 1850 census for Rockingham Co. doesn't show a David or a Noah Row. David Row's wife was a Sheets; they married in Shenandoah Co., but Noah didn't marry there before 1850. The Whetzel history goes on to talk about a Row estate settlement in April 1884, but I think it means David and not Noah.</td></tr>
<tr id=sid70987><td></td><td></td><td>Conley</td><td>William</td><td></td><td>1864</td><td></td><td>killed 1864.  According to tradition, Conley was shot at Jacob Siever’s threshing floor while Jacob May was flailing out grain.  At the close of the Civil War, he was accused of being a “Yankee Spy.”  He courted Jacob Siever’s daughter Leannah.  The flail almost hit Conley’s head as he fell on the threshing floor from where he was sitting on the fence.  He was shot through the heart and fell dead before the shot was heard.  Story from Lewis Yankey’s Dove history, page 39.</td></tr>
<tr id=sid70997><td></td><td></td><td>Bowman</td><td>Edward (or Peter Rader?)</td><td></td><td>1864</td><td></td><td>killed 1864 in Radar Camp Hollow.   This is Lewis Yankey’s version of the story:  During the Civil War Peter Rader was a "Swamp" who stole horses and cattle and took them to WV and sold them.  He had a hideout camp in what is now known as Rader Camp Hollow.  Bowman and other stockmen from the "Valley" shot and killed him, then they took and hanged him from the joist of the log house in the mouth of the hollow.  Rader is buried in the old Caplinger Cemetery at Criders, VA.  Reuben Riggleman who lived on German River close to the mouth of the hollow had a son Philip who was caught in company with Rader.  They let him go but shot at him from a distance peppering him with a load of buckshot in his rear.  Reuben vowed vengeance on Bowman and his companions.  He watched the trail that led across the mountain for days to kill them but had no success.  His wife Phoebe carried food up to him.  There is a Rader Knob and Rader Camp Hollow up there, likely named after him. There do not seem to be entries in the Death Register to verify this story, but perhaps there was a newspaper story]</td></tr>
